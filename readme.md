# Void Ritual

This was one of my entres for Global Game Jam 2016, that I had the privilege to travel to Curitiba to attend on a live event. Since we had some issues and only one person could work on code at the time and I was the least experienced coder with the language (it was Unity and I had it installed the day before), I choose to act mainly as a consultant and doing other small tasks. So I had lot of free time so I decided to work on something else.
Most of the code was reused from my last ludum dare game, which gave me a headstart but it did came out different enough for it to be it's own game and not just a copy.
The theme was ritual and I actually came with the tie in to the theme after the main mechanics were through.

## Controls
* Arrows to move
* R to restart
* F to toggle fullscreen
* Anything else is written on the game

## Objective:
* You're a mage lusting for power and you just performed a ritual to open the Void and collect void stones.
* As the Void pours in our reality the void monsters comes too.
* But they're kinda lazy so they don't hurt you and just throw a fireball at you.
* You need to survive the fireball onslaught and collect gems.
* Collect  gems, survive and attain the highest scores.

## Features:
* Retro looks!
* Highscores!
* Stupid sounds!
* It's actually kinda fun!

## Issues:
* The graphs may be an issue. I was trying to fix fullscreen proportions when I did what I did and I did actually like the aesthetics. You can always toggle fullscreen with F and then resize as you see fit.
* Sound. My computer sound is messed up. So the volumes may be too low or too highr or different. Sorry about that but I don't have another pc to test stuff on currently.
